<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p> This Master's Capstone is an investigation into various Bioinformatics/Computational Biology tools used for the prediction of protein-protein/protein-small molecule interactions, as well as the prediction of Gene Ontologies (GO) on the basis of protein sequence data, genome wide association studies (GWAS), or other methods.</p>

<p>The project will begin fairly broad in scope, but is expected to narrow significantly through meetings with professors and possible collaborators. If a project with privately-generated data is not available, public data sources will be employed.</p>

  <h2> Week of Monday, May 22nd </h2>
  
  <p>Reached out to individuals in the Bioinformatics and Computional Biology (BCB) working group expressing interest in studying: </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Protein Gene Ontology (GO) Labeling (Prof. LC)</li>
    <li>Inferring Protein-Protein Interactions (Prof. LC)</li>
    <li>Precision Medicine (Prof. DS) </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Met with Prof. LC, discussed research interests and was provided with two publications to read:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Singh, R., et al. "Topsy-Turvy: integrating a global view into sequence-based PPI prediction", <i>Bioinformatics</i> (2022)</li>
      <li>Devkota, K., et al. "GLIDER: function prediction from GLIDE-based neighborhoods", <i>Bioinformatics</i> (2022) </li>
    </ul>
  
<br>

<h2> Week of Monday, May 29th</h2>
  
<p>Read publications from previous week, and began to plan meetings with professors from the School of Veterinary Medicine relating to a project on antiody heavy chains and virulence factors associated with Luke Worms (perasites which cause fairly grotesque illnesses animals).</p>

  <p>New publication (not yet in press) added to the must-read list:</p>

  <ul>
        <li>Singh, R., et al. "Learning the Drug-Target Interaction Lexicon", <i>bioRxiv</i> (2022)</li>
  </ul>

<br>

<h2> Week of Monday, June 5th</h2>

<p>Read publication from previous week, preparing for first meeting of the BCG Working Group (with Professors DS and LC) on Friday, June 9th at 10am, for introductions and to discuss more project ideas/details.</p>
