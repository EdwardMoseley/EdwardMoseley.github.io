# pRESTO Prototype Workflow

Note that this document relies completely on Illumina MiSeq 2x250 BCR mRNA [example workflow](https://presto.readthedocs.io/en/stable/workflows/Greiff2014_Workflow.html) from pRESTO (The REpertoire Sequencing TOolkit).

## Data Sources

Focuses on data from: Greiff, V. et al. "Quantitative assessment of the robustness of next-generation sequencing of antibody variable gene repertoires from immunized mice." *BMC Immunol.* (2014)

## Installation and Environment Setup

#### Immcantation

* First, [immcantation v.4.4.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/immcantation/suite) was downloaded via Docker

```
docker pull immcantation/suite:4.4.0
```

* Next, the [SRA Toolkit](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/01.-Downloading-SRA-Toolkit) was downloaded, and the [installation guide](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/02.-Installing-SRA-Toolkit) followed.

#### SRA Toolkit

We need the first 25,000 sequences of sample `ERR346600`, which may downloaded using fastq-dump from the [SRA Toolkit](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/01.-Downloading-SRA-Toolkit).

```
fastq-dump --split-files -X 25000 ERR346600
```

**Schematic of Illumina MiSeq 2x250 stranded paired-end reads without UMI barcodes.**

**Notes (per workflow documentation):**

*Each 250 base-pair read was sequenced from one end of the target cDNA, so that the two reads together cover the entire variable region of the Ig heavy chain. 

* The V(D)J reading frame proceeds from the start of read 2 to the start of read 1. 

* Read 1 is in the opposite orientation (reverse complement), and contains the C-region primer sequence. 

* Both reads begin with a random sequences of 4 nucleotides.
